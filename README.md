# 🎥 Video Player - Model and Controller Implementation

This project implements the model and controller components of a video player application using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. 🚀

## 📁 Project Structure

```
src/
├── model/          # 🎯 Contains the data model and business logic
├── controller/     # 🎮 Handles user input and coordinates between model and view
└── exceptions/     # ⚠️ Custom exception classes for error handling
```

## 🏗️ Architecture
You can see the UML diagram of project in **docs** folder.  
The project follows the MVC pattern with a clear separation of concerns:
- **Model** 🧠: Manages the data and business logic of the video player
- **Controller** 🎮: Acts as an intermediary between the model and view, handling user input and updating the model accordingly
- **Exceptions** ⚠️: Custom exception handling for robust error management
- Note:  You can see the UML diagram of project in **docs** folder.
